# Day 3 — 2026-01-28

## 📝 What I Learned
- How to use **conditional logic** with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Writing **nested conditionals** for multi-step decision making.
- Using `.lower()` to normalize user input.
- Building basic **control flow** for game logic.
- Designing simple **branching narratives**.

## 💻 Project of the Day
- **Name:** Treasure Island 🏝️  
- **Description:**  
A text-based adventure game where the player must make a series of choices to find hidden treasure. Each decision leads to a different outcome, and only one correct path results in winning the game.

The project simulates a classic "choose your own adventure" experience using only terminal input and conditional logic.

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Handling different user inputs consistently.  
  **Solution:** Used `.lower()` on all inputs to avoid issues with capitalization.

- **Challenge:** Keeping nested `if` statements readable.  
  **Solution:** Structured each decision step clearly and grouped related logic together.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Learn how to use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- Start working with loops to allow repeated gameplay.
- Improve game design with more complex paths and outcomes.
