# Day 5 — 2026-02-11

## 📝 What I Learned
- How to use `for` loops to repeat actions a specific number of times.
- How to build and modify lists dynamically using `.append()`.
- How to generate random values using `random.choice()`.
- How to shuffle list elements with `random.shuffle()`.
- How to convert user input into integers for program logic.

## 💻 Project of the Day
- **Name:** Password Generator
- **Description:**  
  A command-line password generator that creates a secure random password based on user-defined criteria, including the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions
- Understanding the difference between generating a password in a fixed order versus a randomized order.
  - Solved by first storing characters in a list, then shuffling the list before joining it into a string.
- Remembering to convert input values from strings to integers using `int()`.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore using `while` loops for input validation.
- Add options for password length presets.
- Learn how to package this logic into reusable functions.
