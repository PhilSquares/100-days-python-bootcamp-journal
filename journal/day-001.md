# Day 1 — 2026-19-01

## 📝 What I Learned
- How to display output using `print()`.
- Writing clean comments to document code.
- Accepting user input with `input()`.
- Debugging by printing variables at different steps.
- String manipulation basics (concatenation).
- Declaring and using variables effectively.

## 💻 Project of the Day
### 🎸 Band Name Generator
- **Scenario:** A friend is starting a new band and needs help coming up with a creative name.  
- **Goal:** Write a program that generates a band name based on user input.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Ask the user for the city they grew up in.  
  - Ask the user for a pet’s name.  
  - Combine them into a potential band name!  

Example:
```pgsql
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
Which city did you grow up in?
> Miami
What is the name of a pet?
> Luna
Your band name could be: Miami Luna
```

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Remembering to use `\n` for new lines in prompts.  
  - **Solution:** Reviewed Python escape sequences and tested input formatting.  
- **Challenge:** Avoiding variable naming errors.  
  - **Solution:** Practiced consistent **snake_case** naming.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore **f-strings** for cleaner string formatting:
  ```python
  print(f"Your band name could be: {city} {pet_name}")
  ```
- Experiment with adding extra inputs (e.g., favorite color or genre).
