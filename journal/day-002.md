# Day 2 — 2026-01-26

## 📝 What I Learned
- How Python handles **primitive data types** (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Mathematical operators including:
  - Division (`/`)
  - Floor division (`//`)
  - Exponents (`**`)
- How to **check data types** using `type()`
- How to **convert between data types** using casting
- The difference between **flooring vs rounding**
- How to use **f-strings** to format output cleanly

## 💻 Project of the Day
- **Name:** Tip Calculator  
- **Description:**  
  A user-input driven program that calculates how much each person should pay after splitting a bill with tip.

  The program asks:
  1. **What was the total bill?**
  2. **How much tip would you like to give? (10, 12, or 15)**  
  3. **How many people are splitting the bill?**

  **Goal:**  
  Use math operations and type casting to calculate the final amount per person.

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** User input is always returned as a string  
  **Solution:** Used `float()` and `int()` to convert input values before calculations.

- **Challenge:** Getting clean output formatting  
  **Solution:** Used `round()` and f-strings to control decimal places and display.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Practice using f-strings in future projects
- Get more comfortable with data type conversions
- Explore how Python handles edge cases (invalid input, decimals, etc.)
