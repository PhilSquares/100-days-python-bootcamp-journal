# Day 4 — 2026-02-02

## 📝 What I Learned
- How to generate random values using Python’s `random` module.
- Working with **lists** to store collections of data.
- Accessing list elements using **indexing**.
- Using lists to drive program logic.
- Building simple game mechanics with randomness.

## 💻 Project of the Day
- **Name:** Rock Paper Scissors  
- **Description:**  
A terminal-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game where the user competes against the computer. The computer’s choice is generated randomly, and the winner is determined using conditional logic and list-based comparisons.

This project demonstrates how randomness and data structures can be combined to simulate real game behavior.

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Mapping numbers to game choices.  
  **Solution:** Used a list to store all possible options and selected them by index.

- **Challenge:** Handling win/lose logic cleanly.  
  **Solution:** Structured conditionals carefully to cover all valid game outcomes.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Learn how to use loops to allow multiple rounds.
- Improve game UX with input validation.
- Refactor logic to reduce nested conditionals.
